Data Challenge

And here is a little data challenge. The Capital Bikeshare company operates about 2,000 rental bicycles and makes all its ride data available to the public. You can find the quarterly trip history data here:

See if you can determine the number of rides during the first quarter of 2015 that lasted less than 60 seconds. If you have an answer, share it with everybody else and explain how you did it, inclduing code.

That's all for today. 

Best regards and please stay in touch!
